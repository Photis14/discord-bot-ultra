# Discord Bot Ultra
Discord Bot Ultra is a customizable Discord bot that can be set up easily. In order to use the bot, you will need a Discord account and a Discord server that you own or have admin privileges on.

# Prerequisites
Before getting started, you will need to complete the following steps:

- Create a Discord account
- Create a Discord server that you own or have admin privileges on

Getting Started
Go to the Discord Developer Portal and click "New Application" in the top right corner. Give your application a name and click "Create".

In the left-hand menu, select "Bot" and click "Add Bot". Customize your bot's username and profile picture as desired.

Under "Token", click "Copy" to copy your bot's token to your clipboard. Keep this token safe, as it is essentially your bot's password and should not be shared with anyone.

Clone this repository on your machine and create a .env file where you store your Discord bot token.

Download and install Node.js if you haven't already.

Create a new directory for your bot's code and navigate to it in your terminal or command prompt.

Run npm init to initialize your project and create a package.json file.

Install the Discord.js library by running npm install discord.js.

In your preferred terminal, run the command node index.js. The message "Bot is online!" should appear.

And that's it! You're ready to start using Discord Bot Ultra on your server.

Thank you for your time, and enjoy using Discord Bot Ultra! If you have any questions or issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to the developer.
